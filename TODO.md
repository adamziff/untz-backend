To do:
- environment variables
- add entropy parameter
- implement dynamic weighting across playlist generation
- get rid of unweighted features array
- sort needs to end quicker, set some threshold for the greedy alg to end
- num_songs_to_select needs to adjust dynamically based on length
- how heavily am i weighting selected songs? is entropy two parameters?
